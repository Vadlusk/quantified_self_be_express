# Quantified Self
is a project designed to teach how seperate backend and frontend applications interact.  Given a basic frontend application written in React (https://github.com/Vadlusk/quantified-self-fe-express), students are tasked with creating three matching backends, the first in Rails, the second in Express, and the third in a language of our choice.  
The application's functionality is that of a basic calorie counter.  The user can add foods to a list and then add foods from that list to any of four meals.  Each food is assigned a number of calories which is subtracted from remaining calories for each meal and for the day (all meals added together).
